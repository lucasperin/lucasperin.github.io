# Moh, the Mogli inspired teen druid.

Moh is a teen durid, raised in the woods by... himself! He is
highly capable of combat and spellcasting. Enjoys a fight and
cares very little for riches.

## Description

Moh is a rough looking boy, with dirty skin and clothes. 
His matted hair and carefree face show his lack of appreciation
for looks. He holds simple a wooden staff and wears a
full silver fured wolf pelt, with the head covering his head 
as a hood. The staff is made of red oak carved with leaf 
patterns from end to end.

### Variant look

Moh can be played as a young or adult human. His looks should
stay the same, with small variations.


## Role-play

Moh is carefree and fearless. He likes a fight and is eager 
for trouble. Adventures are a good way to find trouble and
that should be a priority over rewards. He would likely use
and like magical items, but is not something he seeks. Gold
is secondary, since he likes drinking grape juice at the 
local establishment to wash down that greased roasted boar.
However, he can manage and survive in the wilderness with
little trouble and cares not for riches and luxury. 

Even though Moh is a druid and loves nature, he is rather
an agressive player. He will kill other beasts without
fret if he feels that it is necessary. However, it is
unlikely that he will go on a killing frenzy just for
sport. Say, how will he brag of his victories if his
adversaries are all dead?

Moh has little attachments, but he will stick to a group,
provided that fighting and exploration is a priority. He
cares for others, so he will do whatever he can so that
everyone makes it back safely. This makes it more likely
for them to go out together again, no?

## Battle

Moh likes to take his battles two ways. Either he runs
straight to the fight with his wildshape abilities or
he stays in the back controlling the battlefield. Like
a chess game, he enjoys to see his 'pawns' taking out
the enemy's pieces with his aid. Normaly, however, he
will attempt to get some battlefield advatage before 
he charges in as a brown bear or a dire wolf. In some
cases, he will charge in before everyone straight at
the enemy to test his strength agains stronger enemies.

## Background

Moh is an orphaned kid, raised in the woods. He did not
live all by himself. Although, most of the time, he was
looking for food and shelter alone, when times got hard
he had some help from an elder forest druid. The old
man tought Moh eveything he needed to survive alone, but
never showed his true form. He always appeared as a large
animal, such as a bear, a dire wolf or a giant elk. Moh
learned few tricks like nature spells, summoning magical 
fruits for dinner or making water out of thin air. 

Eventually, the elder druid stopped helping, leaving Moh 
with a wolf cub to his care. For the next few years both
took care of each other, untill a most unfortunate event.
The wolf perished, saving Moh from a wolf pack. Moh comes
back for his friend and takes his hide from the corpse. 
In the wilderness, natural selection keeps only the 
stronger alive. Moh learned it the hard way and will wear 
his friend's pelt even in hot days, takig good care of it.

Finally alone, Moh arrives to the closes town to look for
new experiences. There he understands that he is quite a
brawler and trouble maker. He enjoys this and cares little
for consequences. New adventurers that come to town always
present a good opportunity for new challenges, so he will
seek these parties and join them in their adventures.
